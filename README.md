# Problem Solving with Patrick

Problem Solving with Patrick (PSP) is a multi-part technical field enablement series focused on helping SEs find the best solutions to real world requirements.
The idea is to share experiences across the field team so that real world solutions become widely known.

## How it works

Participating in PSP is totally VOLUNTARY but we know some people in our field team canâ€™t resist a challenge.
The challenge works as follows:

1. Patrick releases a problem and gives the field a week or two to work on it.
1. Conversation ensues in the #problem-solving channel on slack
1. Patrick reveals the solution during a call open to the field. Team members are encouraged to share their solutions and opinions.

During Part 3, there is a focus on leveraging Vanguard created tooling as part of the solution.

## This Asset / Documentation

The cluster hosting this documentation, the documentation itself, and the automation used to demonstrate this example has been built using AssetHub and Powertools. These tools have been built by Vanguard for the field team, enjoy!
